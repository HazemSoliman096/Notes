- open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols.

- OSI consists of :

 1. Physical layer. Transmit raw bits stream over physical medium.
 2. Data link layer. Defines the format of data on the network.
 3. Network layer. Decide which pysical path the data will take.
 4. Transport layer. Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP & UDP.
 5. Session layer. Maintains connection and is responible for controlling ports and sessions.
 6. Presentaion layer. Ensure data is in usable format and where data encryption occurs.
 7. Application layer. Human-computer interaction layer, where application can access the network service.
